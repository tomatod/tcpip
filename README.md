# tcpip
This is toy TCP/IP protocol stack implemention (and also some protocols will probably be implemented for example TLS, DHCP and so on). This is very roughly implemented and may not satisfy each RFC.

## Implemented protocols
| Protocol | Implemention status |
| --- | --- |
| Ethernet | roughly |
| ARP | roughly |
| IP | roughly |
| ICMP | roughly |
| TCP | partially |
| UDP | none |
| TLS | none |
